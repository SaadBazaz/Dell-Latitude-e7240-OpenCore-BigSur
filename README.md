## OpenCore for Dell Latitude e7240 updated for Big Sur with Azurewave AW-CE123H WiFi support

## BigSur fork notes

___UPDATED POST-INSTALLATION TO OPENCORE 0.6.4___

I am just a tech enthusiast and explorer. 
I do not take responsibility for any damage made to your laptop.

### Specs:
  - Intel i5-4310U (4) @ 2.00GHz 
  - Intel HD Graphics 4400 (integrated GPU)
  - 1366x768 display (LED paper, non-touch)
  - 12GB DDR3 RAM
  - ALPs trackpad (built-in laptop)
  - Azurewave AW-CE123H (equivalent to dw1550)

  *Note:* My original WiFi card was **dw1601**, which was not supported. If you have another WLAN card and no knowledge about Hackintosh-ing, don't update unless you are ready to use only LAN connection. See [list of supported WiFi cards](https://osxlatitude.com/forums/topic/11138-inventory-of-supportedunsupported-wireless-cards-2-sierra-big-sur/).
 
 If you have **Mojave** and want to update to Big Sur first update your system to
 Catalina and then proceed
 
 Before updating any kext, create a pendrive copy of the actual EFI so if something doesn't
 work, you can restore it. Backups **always help.**
 
### What works 
 - Built-in keyboard (backlit, with volume keys)
 - Built-in trackpad (multi gestures) - upto 4 finger gestures supported
 - HDMI video/audio with hotplug
 - Native WiFi (2.5GHz and 5GHz) via Azurewave AW-CE123H
 - Bluetooth (with AirDrop and Handoff) using Azurewave AW-CE123H
 - Native USB3.0 and USB2.0
 - Native audio with AppleHDA
 - Built-in mic
 - Built-in camera
 - Native power management
 - Battery status
 - Display backlight controls with smooth transitions, save/restore across restart
 - NVRAM
 - Integrated Graphics
 - Wired Ethernet
 - Harddrive, Battery, WiFi status lights
 - SD Card Reader
 
 _Note: The above is what I've **tested**. There may be things you're looking for which might not be listed. In that case, drop an Issue and get me to test it for you._ 

### What **doesn't** work
 - WiFi manual on/off switch which is on the side of the laptop. It only works for the **Bluetooth module** but NOT WiFi. I found this an odd issue but I'm okay with it. Note: This could be because of my selection of WiFi card. The original had three pins, but this one has two. Good luck with yours.

## ***Below you have info about installation from forked repo***

**OpenCore - post-installation: 0.6.1**





**What you need:**

- Lenovo Y50-70 (or Y70 Haswell) with either 1080p or UHD/4K display
- macOS or OS X downloaded from the Mac App Store
- 8GB USB stick with EFI folder pre-installation on EFI Partition and MacOSX installation.
- Broadcom BCM94352Z for native WiFi (Lenovo FRU: 04X6020, Lenovo PN: 20-200480) or MacOS Broadcom compatible model with BIOS unlock.

**What works:**

Expect to work:
- built-in keyboard (with brightness keys)
- built-in trackpad (multi gestures)
- HDMI video/audio with hotplug
- AirPlay mirroring to AppleTV
- native WiFi via BCM94352Z
- Bluetooth (with handoff) using BCM94352Z
- native USB3
- native audio with AppleHDA
- built-in mic
- built-in camera
- native power management
- battery status
- backlight controls with smooth transitions, save/restore across restart
- accelerated graphics for HD4600 including OpenCL
- wired Ethernet
- retina scaling (in the case of UHD screen)

**Not working:**

- Nvidia GTX 860M 4GB (It doesn't work and it will never work)
- card reader 


**BIOS settings:**

To start, set BIOS to Windows 8 defaults.

Then insure:
- UEFI boot is enabled
- secure boot is disabled
- enable Legacy Boot (but UEFI first) and you may experience less boot time glitches

**For the UHD model, the DVMT-prealloc BIOS setting must be changed to 128MB. One of two methods can be used:**
- use a EFI shell to change the DVMT-prealloc from the shell.
- use a patched BIOS which unlocks the advanced menu

# What you have to do:
 
- Install MacOS with pre-installation EFI

- copy EFI post-installation folder on EFI partition of your HD.

- Modify SMBIOS data with your information for imessage/facetime

(You have to import from your older configuration or generate a new one)
  
    - Use MacSerial to generate your SMBIOS --[Macserial](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/tree/master/Utilities/macserial)
    - MacSerial Example in terminal macserial -a | grep -i iMac19,1
